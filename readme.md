JavaScript Quiz - What is your learning style?

This project was completed as part of my portfolio on the Software Developement Bootcamp at The Developer Academy. 

Week 4 - JavaScript Quiz - Project Brief
The aim of this project is to create a quiz that will ask a series of questions and produce a result on completion of all the answers. 
The quiz should be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should show the following functionality:
1. A single HTML page. The user should not move from the pagewhen answering the questions or getting the results. 
2. A simple design that uses bootstrap elements to manage layout. 
3. A seperate CSS file should be used for styling the page.
4. The quiz should consist of at least 5 multiple choice questions. 
5. The quiz should process the users responses and produce a result at the end.
6. Questions not in use should be hidden. 
7. User response could either be by selecting a radio button or clicking a picture link, but should not use pop up boxes or text entry. 
8. The result should be hidden until the end.
9. Initial information about the quiz should be displayed when the user first opens the page. This should be hidden whilst the user answers questions and when the results are displayed. 
10. Functions should be reused where possible.
